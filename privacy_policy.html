    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Upload to ImageKit (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Google Chrome extension that allows users to upload images from any webpage directly to their ImageKit account.

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Images:</strong> When you choose to upload an image from any web page, the extension accesses the image data to facilitate the upload to your ImageKit account.
